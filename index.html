            Welcome!
        </h1>

    <p>
        We're so excited to share our love of animals with our neighbors, and we hope you come visit soon. Whether you stop by once while you're passing through town or come multiple times a week, you'll find the Ithaca Zoo is ready to welcome you with open arms.
    </p>

    <p>
        Advisory: due to upcoming hot weather, we advise all guests to make sure they bring sunscreen for protection from ultraviolet rays and a water bottle to help stay hydrated. We have water fountains all over the zoo where you can fill up. Just look for the signs that say "<em>Watering Hole</em>."
